Code to create a language independent e-commerce web site API. 
I used this particular code for selling real-estate, but it can be easily changed to serve of any type of commecial web site. 

Upon its creation it was relevant, but then replaced by modern stuff like Linux, google translate and other AI tools in the 21st century.

You'll need a VB6 compiler for windows 32 (stone-age junk, including MS-anything) to make it work.

Notice: this is a highly insecure solution (runs on windows).

Installation instructions coming soon! (year 3000)
